# 100ProjectsOfCode
Completing 100ProjectsOfCode by https://github.com/aceking007/100ProjectsOfCode.git

A list of practical knowledge-building projects. As the projects are aimed to increase your knowledge base, they are somewhat challenging. However, there are a few easy ones too. Many of them are even worthy enough to showcase on your portfolio.
The projects are divided into multiple categories and tagged with some suggested languages and frameworks/tools (I'm still working on this part) to get you started.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project ideas:
1. Pick a project from the list
2. Create a GitHub repository for the project
3. Start working, possibly from scratch (reinvent the wheel if you have to!)
4. When done, test it, and share with the tag #100ProjectsOfCode somewhere in the README of the repo
5. Fork this repo
6. Check the completed item, and repeat with another project idea

### Physics Engine

Video Games work on [physics engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_engine). Build your own. You can later use this engine to build games or carry out simulations. Try building a 2D or 3D physics engine that can handle collision, movement, acceleration, gravity, and other forces in the system. You may need to first understand a bit of physics to be able to build something, so take your time for this one.

**Suggested Language**: Processing (any other language that you feel comfortable with works too)  
**Suggested Frameworks/Tools**:  
**Example Implementation**:

### Flappy Bird AI

**Suggested Language**:  
**Suggested Frameworks/Tools**:  
**Example Implementation**:

### Tic Tac Toe AI

Build an AI that is unbeatable (either wins always or at least draws) in tic-tac-toe. Instead of just hardcoding what move to play when, build an AI that learns how to play and then devises strategies to win.

**Suggested Language**:  
**Suggested Frameworks/Tools**:  
**Example Implementation**:

### Elevator Simulator

Build a simulation for an elevator. This may seem like a random simulation, but you need to think a lot before implementing something regarding this, which floor to go to when two buttons are pressed? Is there any change if you add a preference for going up or going down? and so on.

**Suggested Language**:  
**Suggested Frameworks/Tools**:  
**Example Implementation**:

### Simulate the World

Build a simulation of the whole world. Try to be as detailed as you can. Keep it simple when you feel stuck and slowly improve on it. Treat it as a self-sustaining game if it makes things easier. For bonus points, add an AI to the system to let it work on its own.

**Suggested Language**: C++ (or C - you will need a fast language for the simulation)  
**Suggested Frameworks/Tools**: Unity (Good for visualizations)  
**Example Implementation**: [The Bibites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myJ7YOZGkv0&ab_channel=TheBibites), [Simulating Ecosystem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_It_X7v-1E&ab_channel=SebastianLague) by Sebastian Lague

### Character Generator

Build a tool that will generate random characters for games that you play/build like Pathfinder or Divinity: Original Sin. First implement a random character generator and then tweak it to make characters that you will like (add an AI).

**Suggested Language**:  
**Suggested Frameworks/Tools**:  
**Example Implementation**:

### Game of Life

[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) simulates the lives of simple cells that obey algorithmic laws. You can read the algorithmic rules from the wikipedia page and implement them. Make the program capable of graphical rendering to display the end product.

**Suggested Language**: Processing, JavaScript  
**Suggested Frameworks/Tools**: P5.js (JavaScript)  
**Example Implementation**:

## Miscellaneous  

### Deal Finder

Build a simple web app to notify you when an item you covet goes on sale for a good price. You can use a web scraper to pull the item's product page and notify you of any price changes.

**Suggested Language**:  
**Suggested Frameworks/Tools**:  
**Example Implementation**:

### Expense Tracker

Create a simple interface (web app/phone app) you can use to add and categorize your expense. Generate monthly reports based on the inputs and write custom alerts for things like, "spending too much on coffee... as always".

**Suggested Language**:  
**Suggested Frameworks/Tools**:  
**Example Implementation**:

### Recipe Generator

The app (or service) should generate new recipes/scrapes recipes from the web. So when you cook by its recipe, you rate it to tell it how good the recipe was.

**Suggested Language**:  
**Suggested Frameworks/Tools**:  
**Example Implementation**:

### Emoji Translator

Build a browser extension that will translate any provided sentence into a combination of emojis. You can use the extension to automatically change texts that a user sends via messaging or email or even use it to aid in writing blog posts.

**Suggested Language**: JavaScript  
**Suggested Frameworks/Tools**:  
**Example Implementation**:

### Regex Query Tool

Build a search tool that implements Regular Expressions. With it you can easily search for text matching a pattern in websites or documents that you may be writing or browsing.
